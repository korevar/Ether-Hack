This is a cheat written in Java(API) and LUA(GUI) for Project Zomboid. It is aimed at providing the game with additional functionality that allows users to get some benefits. Please use responsibly and understand the consequences that may arise as a result of improper use.
The performance of the cheat was tested on the latest version of the game `41.78.16 (Steam)` (July 09, 2023).

You can watch the cheat [installation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Olx7O3HyeZc) and see its main functions in action.

(*) - These functions work in multiplayer, provided that some types of anti-cheats are disabled, otherwise it will kick. As a rule, for servers with mods, some types are disabled, for example, [type 12](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/other-mmorpg-and-strategy/522818-project-zomboid-anti-cheat-types.html), but for full operation, [type 8](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/other-mmorpg-and-strategy/522818-project-zomboid-anti-cheat-types.html) is required to be disabled

(**) - It only works when creating a character from the main menu, that is, points will not be added to the menu after death. Solution: after death, log out of the server and connect again.

## Getting Started

This section will provide information on how to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

This tool requires:

-   [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or newer
-   Steam copy of [Project Zomboid](https://store.steampowered.com/app/108600/Project_Zomboid/)

### Installation

1. Download and install Java on your computer
2. Make sure that the path to Java is set in your environment variables

(For Windows: `WIN + X` -> `"System"` -> `"Advanced System Parameters"` -> `"Environment Variables"` -> `Double click on "Path"` -> `Insert path to java, for example "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-20\bin"`)

3. Clone the repository
4. Open the project in the IDE and build the executable via Gradle `.jar` file
5. Move the created `.jar` to the root folder of the game 

(For example, `c:\Steam\steamapps\common\ProjectZomboid`)

6. Open the console in the root folder and run the following command: 

```
java -jar ./EtherHack-{yourVersion}.jar --install
```

`{yourVersion}` - Specify your version of the cheat

For example, for release 1.1, the command will look like this:
```
java -jar ./EtherHack-1.1.jar --install
```
### Uninstallation
Open the console in the root folder and run the following command:
```
java -jar ./EtherHack-{yourVersion}.jar --uninstall
```

`{yourVersion}` - Specify your version of the cheat

For example, for release 1.1, the command will look like this:
```
java -jar ./EtherHack-1.1.jar --uninstall
```

## Usage

After successfully installing the cheat, you need to log in to the game. When loading, the cheat logo will appear in front of the main logo, in the game itself (menu and in the game session) in the lower left corner there will be information about the cheat. The name of the game window will also change.

To open the cheat menu, press `Insert`

To reload the LuaGUI, press `Home`, but first make sure that all the cheat windows are closed, otherwise an error will appear.

## For developer
If you are a developer and want to expand the functionality, you can do it as follows:

In the project folder located on the path `src/main/resources/EtherHack/lua` there is a single file responsible for rendering the entire user interface of the cheat. You can edit it using examples from game files.

Also, Eterhack provides the ability to add custom methods from Java to lua, for this in the `src/main/java/EtherHack/Ether/EtherAPI.java` needs to find the `public static class GlobalEtherAPI` and add it according to the available examples:

```java
@LuaMethod(
         name = "yourMethodName",
        global = true
)
public static String yourMethodName() {
    return "Test!";
}
```
After adding and reassembling the cheat, you will be able to call this method in lua:

```lua
print(yourMethodName());
--Output log: Test!
```
In addition, you can load third-party Lua in any other Lua through the `EtherRequire` method:

```lua
EtherRequire "path/to/your.lua"
```

The path to Lua must be specified relative to the root folder of the game
